In this project, you’ll look at Euro Cup 2016 data and write queries to answer our questions.
The data can be downloaded here (for Linux and MacOS users) and here (for Windows
Users). Please extract the ZIP archive downloaded to a folder and import data contained in
the CSV files to a database using the following steps:
1. Create a new database named euro_cup_2016 :
mysql> CREATE SCHEMA euro_cup_2016;
2. Follow the instructions as given in the documentation to import the CSV files from the
ZIP archive into the database.
Please use the database name that you created above (when in step as shown in
figure Figure 6.16 in the documentation).
Please configure the table names same as the CSV file names.
The data model for the data can be found here. In order to understand the content of the
tables and what data each column contains, please refer to this document.
